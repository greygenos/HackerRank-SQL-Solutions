/*
Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, 
immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical 
(i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), 
AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S). 

2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. 
Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following
format:  There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in 
OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. 
If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should
be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.
